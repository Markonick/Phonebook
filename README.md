# Phonebook

This is just a quick MVC project with one controller that receives an action from the view

and passes it on to an http client that consumes a public api.

No authentication involved.

Please not that because .net core and latest resharper on VS2017 are not properly supported, there is little test coverage

Task is to build a single page application that will play the role of a phone book.  

Requirements 

- use this api to get the data you need:
